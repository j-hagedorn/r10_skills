<p>The table below provides a quick summary of responses grouped by activity. You can sort by any of the fields to look at the relationship of different variables. Here’s a quick definition of each of the columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong># doing</strong>: The number of people who report doing an activity at any of the following frequencies: <code>Occasionally (3-4x month)</code>,<code>Frequently (2-3x week)</code>, or <code>Daily</code>.</li>
<li><strong># interested</strong>: The number of people who reported being <code>Very interested</code> in the activity.</li>
<li><strong>Level of Use</strong>: The average score for frequency of use, where the responses are coded as follows: <code>Never</code> = 0,<code>Rarely (1-2x month)</code> = 1,<code>Occasionally (3-4x month)</code> = 2, <code>Frequently (2-3x week)</code> = 3, <code>Daily</code> = 4.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>Level of Interest</strong>: The average score for frequency of use, where the responses are coded as follows: <code>Not Interested</code> = 0,<code>Somewhat Interested</code> = 1,<code>Very Interested</code> = 2.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement</strong>: The average level of engagement in a given activity. Engagement here is defined at the individual level as the relationship of <code>Level of Interest</code> to <code>Level of Use</code>, so that a higher number means that a person is less interested than they are currently using the skill. A lower number, on the other hand, indicates that the person is interested but not currently using the skill.</li>

<h1>Clusters of Interests across Team Members</h1>
<p>The heatmap below shows which team members voiced an interest in developing particular skills. Those who marked <em>“Very interested”</em> are shown with dark blue squares. People who indicated similar, strong interests are grouped close to each other. As you can see by the chart, the team members at the top of the chart endorsed strong interests across the spectrum of skills and activities listed on the survey, while those at the bottom had fewer interests, sometimes in specific areas. It is worth noting that this does not necessarily take into account individuals who noted <em>“Somewhat interested”</em> in a given category.</p>
